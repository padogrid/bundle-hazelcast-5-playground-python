# Configuration element's name is "components".
# * "components":
#   A list of component elements defining additional Panel compliant components
#   to be added in Playground. It has the following attributes.
#  
# * "component":
#   Defined a component. It has the following attributes.
#
# * "name":
#   Name of the component. If not specified, then it default to the component's class name.
# * "title":
#   Title to of the component displayed in Playground. If not specified then it defaults to name.
# * "class":
#   Fully-qualified class name of the component. This class must be compliant with the Panel
#   customer widget requirements.
# * "panel":
#   Panel template pane. Valid values are 'main' and 'sidebar'. If not specified or an invalid
#   then it defaults to 'main'. If 'main', then the component is displayed in the main area.
#   If 'sidebar', then the component is displayed in the sidebar area.
# * "root":
#   The root pane name. If unspecified, then the component is displayed in the top pane
#   without tabs. If specified, then it places the component in a tab named with this
#   value in the template pane defined by the "panel" attribute. By using the same "root"
